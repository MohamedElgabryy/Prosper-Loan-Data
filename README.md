# Prosper-Loan-Data
<br/>
Online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending markets enable individual consumers to borrow from, and lend money to, one another directly. We study the borrower-, loan- and group- related determinants of performance predictability in an online P2P lending market by conceptualizing financial and social strength to predict borrower rate and whether the loan would be timely paid.
<br/>
Our goal is to explore a sample of Prosper loan data to uncover borrower motivations when applying for loans, and identify several factors that may influence loan favorability.
